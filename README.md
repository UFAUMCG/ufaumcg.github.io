Website for UFA|UMCG originally designed by Innovative Design. Currently maintained internally.

### Overview
The website is currently hosted at <https://ufaumcg.github.io> and also uses the domain ufaumcg.com. The website is purely static. The CSS is written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and the script files use jQuery for simplicity. The images used for the site are stored in the `public` folder.

### Updating the website
Currently the website files live in a Github repository owned by UFA|UMCG. The HTML files are fairly straightforward. To add new entries to officers or another table for the careers page, just follow the format already outlined.
